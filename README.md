# Centos-box
Using vagrant and Ansible to setup a box with CentOS 7.x with PHP(-FPM), MariaDB and more.

Also works fine under Windows due to the bootstrap file which installs ansible locally on the box itself and lets the box provision itself

##Notes
- Requires Vagrant 1.7.2 on host
- Requires Virtualbox on host

Still very much a Work in progress!
